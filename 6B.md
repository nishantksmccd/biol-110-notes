# Module 6B
* Genes, Telomeres, and Chromosomes are all made of DNA

* Laying in the sun can increase risk of skin cancer
* *Proto-onco genes* are a normal type of gene that has code for proteins that signal cells to divide
	* Often have a gain-of-function mutation in cancerous cells
	* Code for proteins that trigger apoptosis
	* Often the “gas pedal” in mitosis
* Mitosis, the same process that occurs in cancer, is a normal cell function that has gone out of control
* Most mutations that cause cancer occur within a person's lifetime and are not inherited
* Cancer is normally the result of several DNA mutations
* *Telomerase* is the enzyme that repairs telomeres.
* Cells with long telomeres can continue to undergo mitosis
* *Tumor-surpressor genes* are the counterpart of proto-onco genes which regulate a cell’s mitosis
	* Often have a loss-of-function mutation in cancerous cells
	* Often the “brake pedal” in mitosis

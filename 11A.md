# Module 11A
* **Metabolism** refers to all the chemical processes that occur within cells to maintain life.
  * can be categorized into two types: catabolism and anabolism.
  * regulated by various factors, including enzyme activity, cellular signals, and feedback mechanisms.
  * plays a crucial role in cellular energy production, nutrient utilization, growth, and other physiological processes in living organisms.
* **Catabolism** involves the breakdown of larger molecules into smaller molecules, releasing energy in the process.
* **Anabolism** involves the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller molecules, requiring energy input.
* Metabolic pathways are sequences of chemical reactions that are interconnected and regulated to efficiently manage cellular energy and maintain cellular function.
* ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a universal energy currency in cells, used to store and transfer energy for cellular work.
* **Enzymes** are biological catalysts that facilitate metabolic reactions by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur.

# Module 13A
* Energy and matter flow through ecosystems through the processes of **photosynthesis**, **cellular respiration**, and **decomposition**.
* Producers (**autotrophs**) convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy through photosynthesis, which is used by consumers (**heterotrophs**) for energy and growth.
* The cycling of matter in ecosystems is driven by biogeochemical cycles, which include the water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and phosphorus cycle.
* The **carbon cycle** involves the movement of carbon atoms through living and nonliving components of the environment, with carbon dioxide serving as a critical molecule in the process.
* The food chain and food web show the transfer of energy from one organism to another, with each trophic level receiving only 10% of the energy from the previous level due to energy loss through respiration and waste.
* **Energy and matter are not destroyed** but are transformed and recycled through the ecosystem

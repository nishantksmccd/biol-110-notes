* Speciation is the process by which one species splits into two or more new species.
* There are two main mechanisms of speciation: allopatric and sympatric.
* **Allopatric speciation** occurs when a physical barrier such as a mountain range or a body of water separates a population, leading to the formation of two or more distinct species over time.
* **Sympatric speciation** occurs when a new species arises within the same geographic area as the parent species, often as a result of polyploidy, which is the duplication of chromosome sets.
* In addition to these mechanisms, hybridization can also lead to speciation when two distinct species mate and produce viable offspring that are reproductively isolated from both parent species.
* **Polyploidy** is the duplication of a cellâ€™s chromosomes, resulting in a new species with twice the normal number of chromosomes.
* Habitat differentiation occurs when subpopulations of a species develop different ecological niches and become reproductively isolated as a result.
* Sexual selection occurs when individuals with certain traits have a higher chance of mating and passing on those traits to their offspring, leading to reproductive isolation.

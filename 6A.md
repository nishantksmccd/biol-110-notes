# Module 6A
* Frameshift Mutation - Deletion, Insertion
* Mutations are mistakes in a cellâ€™s DNA
* What mutations arise at the level of DNA, the impact is observed at the protein level
* Types of Mutations:
	* *Frameshift Mutation*: When a DNA mutation causes a change in the reading frame of a molecule of DNA
	* *Deletion Mutation*: A type of point mutation where a base is removed from a molecule of DNA
	* *Silent Mutation*: When a DNA mutation does NOT impact the sequence of amino acids in a protein
	* *Substitution Mutation:* A type of point mutation where one base is replaced by a different base
	* *Missense Mutation*: When a DNA mutation results in a change in the amino acid sequence in the resulting protein.
	* *Nonsense Mutation*: When a DNA mutation results in an early STOP codon
	* *Insertion Mutation*: A type of point mutation where an additional base is added to a molecule of DNA

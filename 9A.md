**Microevolution:**
* Microevolution is a process of evolutionary change that occurs within a species or population.
* It is driven by four main mechanisms: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection.
* Mutation is the source of genetic variation, and it can create new alleles.
* Gene flow is the movement of alleles from one population to another, which can increase genetic diversity.
* Genetic drift is a change in allele frequencies in a population due to random events, such as genetic bottlenecks or founder effects.
* Natural selection is a process by which organisms with traits that are favorable in a given environment survive and reproduce more successfully than others.

**Macroevolution:**
* Macroevolution is a process of evolutionary change that occurs above the level of the species, resulting in the formation of new species or higher taxa.
* It is driven by three main mechanisms: speciation, extinction, and adaptive radiation.
* Speciation is the process by which one species splits into two or more species.
* Extinction is the disappearance of a species or higher taxon from the Earth.
* Adaptive radiation is the diversification of a group of organisms into new forms, each adapted to a different ecological niche.

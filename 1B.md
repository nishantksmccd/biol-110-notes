# Module 1B
*Cell Theory:* All living things are made up of cells (the cell is the base unit of life)
* Cells arise from other cells through cell division
* All cells have:
	* Plasma membrane
	* DNA
	* Cytoplasm
	* Ribosomes

* Bacteria is alive. It’s a simple celled organism.

* Viruses are note made up of cells — they are instead DNA *or* RNA wrapped in protein and reproduce by taking over other cells.

* Prions don’t have DNA and are just a misshapen protein.

* Yeasts are a lot more complicated — still single-celled, but much more complex and difficult to treat due to similarity to human cells.

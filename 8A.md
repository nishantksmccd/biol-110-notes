# Module 8A
* Mendel’s laws are not absolute rules and there are exceptions and variations that do not follow classical Mendelian genetics.
* I**ncomplete dominance** occurs when 
	* the phenotype of a heterozygous individual is intermediate between the two homozygous genotypes.
	* when the heterozygous phenotype is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes.
* **Codominance** occurs when 
	* both alleles are expressed equally in a heterozygous individual.
	* both alleles contribute to the phenotype of a heterozygote.
* **Epistasis** occurs when the expression of one gene affects the expression of another gene.
* Multiple alleles exist when there are more than two alternative forms of a gene present in a population.
* Multiple alleles are variations of a single gene that result in different phenotypes.
* Polygenic inheritance occurs when multiple genes determine the phenotype of a trait.
* Pleiotropy occurs when one gene affects multiple traits.
* Mendelian genetics is the study of how traits are passed down from parents to offspring.
* Mendel’s laws include the law of segregation, law of independent assortment, and law of dominance.
* The law of segregation states that alleles separate during gamete formation and only one allele from each parent is passed down to offspring.
* The law of independent assortment states that alleles of different genes assort independently of each other during gamete formation.
* The law of dominance states that one allele can mask the expression of another allele.

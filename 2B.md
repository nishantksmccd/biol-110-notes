# Module 2B
An *Ionic bond* is a chemical bond between ions of different and opposite charge.
A *Covalent bond* includes the mutual sharing of one or more pairs of electrons between /two/ atoms.

Atoms are the smallest unit of matter. The basic part of an element is an atom. Mollecules are a group of atoms bound together.

*Polar bonds* are covalent bonds. They prefer one nucleus over another.
*Hydrogen bonds* are formed when one slightly positive charge is attracted to a negative charge.

Four categories of biomollecules:
* Carbohydrates
* Proteins
* Nucleic Acids
* Lipids

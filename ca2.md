# Cumulative Assessment 2 Notes
## Module 6B: Energy Flow and Trophic Levels
* Energy flows through ecosystems from producers to consumers and decomposers
* Trophic levels illustrate the transfer of energy between organisms in an ecosystem

## Module 7A: Population Ecology
* Populations are groups of individuals of the same species living in the same area
* Factors that affect population growth include birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration
* Population growth can be modeled using exponential and logistic growth models

## Module 7B: Community Ecology
* A community is all the populations of different species living in the same area
* Community structure is determined by interactions between species, including competition, predation, and symbiosis

## Module 8A: Biomes
* Biomes are large areas of the earth with similar climate and vegetation
* The major biomes include tropical rainforest, savanna, desert, temperate grassland, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, and tundra
Module 8B: Conservation Biology
* Conservation biology aims to protect biodiversity and manage human impacts on ecosystems
* Threats to biodiversity include habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation, pollution, and climate change
* Conservation strategies include habitat restoration, captive breeding, and protected areas

## Module 9A: Evolution
* Evolution is the process by which species change over time
* Mechanisms of evolution include natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation
* Evidence of evolution includes the fossil record, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology

## Module 9B: Speciation
* Speciation is the process by which new species form
* Modes of speciation include allopatric, sympatric, and parapatric speciation

## Module 10A: Phylogenetics
* Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships between organisms
* Phylogenetic trees are used to illustrate these relationships based on genetic and morphological data
* The principles of parsimony and maximum likelihood are used to construct phylogenetic trees.

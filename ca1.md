# Cumulative Assessment 1 Notes
## Module 1B: Cells and Organelles
* The cell is the basic unit of life and all living organisms are composed of cells
* The structure of a cell determines its function
* The plasma membrane surrounds and protects the cell, and regulates the movement of materials in and out of the cell
* The cytoplasm contains various organelles, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and ribosomes
* Each organelle has a specific function that contributes to the overall function of the cell

## Module 2A: DNA, RNA, and Protein Synthesis
* DNA is the genetic material that carries the instructions for building and maintaining an organism
* RNA is a molecule that helps to carry out the instructions encoded in DNA
* Protein synthesis involves the process of transcription, in which RNA is synthesized from DNA, and translation, in which the RNA is used to synthesize proteins
* Mutations can occur during DNA replication, which can result in changes to the genetic code and potentially affect protein synthesis

## Module 2B: Cell Cycle and Mitosis
* The cell cycle is a series of events that cells go through as they grow and divide
* Mitosis is the process by which cells divide to create two daughter cells, each with a complete set of chromosomes
* Mitosis is important for growth, repair, and maintenance of tissues

## Module 3A: Mendelian Genetics
* Gregor Mendel is considered the father of genetics for his work on the inheritance of traits in pea plants
* Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment describe how traits are inherited from one generation to the next
* The Punnett square is a tool that can be used to predict the probability of offspring inheriting certain traits from their parents

## Module 3B: Non-Mendelian Inheritance
* Some traits are not inherited according to Mendelian patterns
* Incomplete dominance occurs when neither allele is completely dominant, resulting in an intermediate phenotype
* Codominance occurs when both alleles are expressed in the phenotype
* Multiple alleles and polygenic inheritance also contribute to variation in traits

## Module 4A: Evolution
* Evolution is the process of change in a population over time, driven by mechanisms such as natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation
* Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection proposes that individuals with traits that increase their fitness in a particular environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring
* Evidence for evolution includes fossil records, biogeography, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology

## Module 4B: Speciation and Macroevolution
* Speciation occurs when one species splits into two or more distinct species
* Reproductive isolation is a key factor in speciation, as it prevents gene flow between populations
* Macroevolution refers to large-scale evolutionary changes that result in the formation of new species, higher taxa, and the diversity of life on Earth

## Module 5A: Ecology
* Ecology is the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment
* The levels of ecological organization include individual, population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere
* Energy flows through ecosystems in the form of food chains and food webs, with producers converting sunlight into chemical energy that is transferred through trophic levels
* Biogeochemical cycles, such as the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle, recycle elements through the biosphere

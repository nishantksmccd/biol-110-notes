# Module 8B
* **Microevolution** describes the evolution of populations
* **Macroevolution** describes the emergence of new species over long periods of time
* Many traits are not perfectly structured for their use, but function well enough to give an organism a competitive advantage
* **Scientific Theory**: an explanation for an aspect of the natural world that is supported by extensive evidence
	* No other plausible explanations exist
* Natural Selection maintains favorable alleles whether they are dominant or recessive
* Evolution does not address how life began
* Microevolution happens over several generations

# Module 7A
* Meiosis is a division process that produces haploid cells, which are sex cells or gametes with half as many chromosomes as the starting cell.
* Homologous chromosomes separate during the first round of meiosis, called meiosis I, while sister chromatids separate during the second round, called meiosis II.
* Meiosis occurs in four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
* During prophase I, the chromosomes begin to condense and pair up with their homologous partner through crossing over, where two chromatids exchange fragments of DNA.
* Crossing over is helped along by a protein structure called the synaptonemal complex.
* Chiasmata, cross-shaped structures where homologues are linked together, keep the homologues connected to each other after the synaptonemal complex breaks down, and each homologous pair needs at least one.
* Genetic variation in humans
	* Comes from mutations
	* Crossing over of homologous chromosomes during meiosis
	* Independent Assortment
* Mitosis causes growth by producing genetically identical cells
* Meiosis:
	* Produces Gametes
	* Results in genetically variable cells
	* Produces haploid cells
	* Results in four daughter cells
* Mitosis
	* Results in genetically identical cells
	* Results in two daughter cells
	* Produces body cells (all cells besides sex cells)
	* Produces diploid cells
* There is less than a 0.1 percent chance that you will have identical twins

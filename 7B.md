# Module 7B
* Gregor Mendel is considered the father of modern genetics due to his groundbreaking work with pea plants in the mid-1800s.
* Mendel formulated three principles of inheritance: the law of segregation, the law of independent assortment, and the law of dominance.
* **The law of segregation** states that each individual carries two copies of each gene, which separate during gamete formation so that each gamete receives only one copy.
* **The law of independent assortment** states that the inheritance of one gene does not affect the inheritance of another gene.
* **The law of dominance** states that in a heterozygous individual (one with two different alleles for a particular trait), the dominant allele will be expressed while the recessive allele will be masked.
* Mendel’s experiments involved selectively breeding pea plants with different traits, such as tall versus short or yellow versus green peas.
* Mendel’s work showed that traits are inherited in a predictable manner and that genes are passed down from generation to generation.
* **Incomplete dominance** occurs when neither allele is dominant, and the resulting phenotype is intermediate between the two homozygous phenotypes.
* **Codominance** occurs when both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype of a heterozygote, resulting in a phenotype that shows both traits.
* Multiple alleles exist for some traits, such as human blood type, and the ABO blood type system illustrates both codominance and multiple alleles.
* Polygenic inheritance occurs when multiple genes contribute to a single trait, resulting in a range of phenotypic expression.
* Environmental factors can also influence phenotype, including temperature, light, and nutrition.
* In a situation where an individual has both a dominant and a recessive allele, the individual will have the phenotype of the dominant trait.
* **Phenotype**: an observable characteristics an individual has
* **Heterozygote**: When an individual has two different alleles for a gene
* **Genotype**: the genetic information an individual has

# Module 4B
* *Transcription* is the process of “turning” DNA into mRNA. In order to do this,
	* Swap C and G
	* Turn A to U
	* Turn T to A
* Nothing happens to the DNA during transcription and translation!
* *Translation* is the process of chaining an amino acid into a protein from mRNA.
	* It happens when mRNA enters a ribosome and the codons read it
	* They read until they find a start codon (AUG) and translate it. They start producing amino acids from there.
	* They stop producing mRNA when they encounter a stop codon.

# Module 14A
* **Energy flow** through ecosystems is the transfer of energy from one organism to another through food webs and food chains.
* **Food chains** show a simple, linear sequence of energy transfer, while food webs show the interconnected and complex nature of energy flow in ecosystems.
* **Trophic levels** describe the feeding position of an organism in a food chain or web.
* **Community ecology** studies the interactions among populations of species that inhabit the same area.
* **Competition** is the interaction among organisms that use the same resources in a particular ecosystem.
* **Predation** is the interaction between a predator and prey species.
* **Symbiosis** is a close, long-term interaction between two different species, such as mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism.
* **Keystone species** are species that have a disproportionately large effect on the structure of an ecosystem, despite their low abundance or biomass.
* **Commensialism** is a relationsihp where one organism benefits and the other doesn't really care
* Producer -> Primary consumer -> secondary consumer -> Tertiary consumer
  * Some can be multiple

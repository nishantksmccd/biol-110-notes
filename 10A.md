# Module 10A
* Macroevolution refers to large-scale evolutionary changes that occur over long periods of time above the species level.
* These changes are driven by genetic variation, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, and can result in the emergence of new species, extinction of old ones, and diversification of lineages.
* One example of macroevolution is the evolution of whales, which are believed to have evolved from land mammals around 50 million years ago.
* This process involved a series of adaptations for aquatic life, such as changes in the structure of their limbs, modification of their respiratory system, and development of echolocation.
* Evidence for macroevolution includes the fossil record, comparative anatomy, embryology, biogeography, and molecular biology.
* Fossils provide a record of the past and allow us to trace the evolutionary history of organisms, as well as determine the relative ages of different groups.
* Comparative anatomy allows us to compare the physical structures of different organisms and determine their evolutionary relationships, as well as identify homologous and analogous structures.
* Embryology shows similarities in the early development of different organisms, which suggests that they share a common ancestry.
* Biogeography examines the distribution of organisms and how it is influenced by continental drift and other factors, which can help explain the evolutionary history of different groups.
* Molecular biology uses DNA and other molecular data to compare the genetic makeup of different organisms and identify similarities and differences that reflect their evolutionary relationships.

# Module 14B
* Not all species in an ecosystem have strong interactions
	* removal of some species has little or no effect on others.
* **Apex predators**: predators at the top of a food web that are not preyed on by others.  
	* Removal or addition of an apex predator that is a keystone species causes changes in the type and number of species, and their population sizes, at multiple trophic levels.
* **Keystone species** are critical to maintaining the diversity and stability of an ecosystem.  
	* have direct and indirect effects on the abundance and number of species in an ecosystem that are disproportionately large relative to their own abundance in the ecosystem.
* Identifying the interactions among species in an ecosystem and determining how species numbers and population sizes are regulated requires experiments conducted over long time periods. 
* In salt marshes, primary producers such as plants play a crucial role in supporting the food web.
* Presence of predators at higher trophic levels can regulate herbivore populations.
* The removal of predators can lead to an increase in herbivore populations and negatively impact salt marsh vegetation.
* Herbivores can have direct and indirect effects on the marsh by consuming plants and altering the physical structure of the habitat.
* Salt marshes are highly productive and provide essential services such as carbon sequestration and storm surge protection.
* Understanding trophic cascades and the interconnectedness of species in salt marsh ecosystems is vital for their conservation and management.

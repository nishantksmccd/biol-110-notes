# Module 12A
* **Metabolism** refers to all of the chemical reactions that occur within a cell or organism, including catabolic and anabolic pathways.
* **Catabolic pathways** break down complex molecules into simpler ones and release energy, while anabolic pathways build complex molecules and require energy input.
* The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
* The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe.
* **Photosynthesis** is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in the bonds of glucose and other organic molecules.
  * occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).
* The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.
* **The Calvin cycle** occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts and uses the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.
* **Cellular respiration** is the process by which cells break down glucose and other organic molecules to release energy in the form of ATP.
  * occurs in three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
* **Glycolysis** occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH.
* **The Krebs cycle** occurs in the mitochondria and produces more ATP, NADH, and FADH2 by further breaking down pyruvate.
* **Oxidative phosphorylation** occurs in the mitochondria and uses the energy stored in the NADH and FADH2 produced by glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to produce a large amount of ATP.
